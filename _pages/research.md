## Interests

- **Statistical inference for networks:** latent space models, community detection, spectral graph inference.
- **High-dimensional data analysis:** variable selection, dimensionality reduction, covariance estimation, convex optimization.
- **Statistical machine learning and pattern recognition:** classification, regression, clustering, graph matching.
- **Applications to neuroimaging:** statistical connectomics.

<summary> <b>Overview</b> (<i>click to expand</i>) </summary><p>

I am interested in the statistical, theoretical and computational aspectsof methodologies for problems that arise in "big-data", particularly the ones involving *complex and high-dimensional datasets*. My research focuses on a synergistic approach to combine the following themes.

- Developing new statistical methodologies for complex and high-dimensional data to make*interpretable and efficient inferences* by exploiting low-dimensional structures in the data.

- Constructing *computationally efficient and robust algorithms* for large-scale data analysis, in particular through spectral methods and convex optimization.

- Studying the theoretical aspects of the above problems within a formal statistical framework to *quantify uncertainty* and to better *understand their non-asymptotic performanceand limitations*.

- Applying these methodologies to relevant scientific problems,  with a special focus on neuroscience applications to understand the connectivity of the brain.

Broadly speaking, my work can be classified into three areas: statistical modeling,estimation and inference for network analysis, supervised and unsupervised learning methods forcomplex data types, and methodology and theory for pattern recognition in graphs.

<summary> <b>Network analysis</b> (<i>click to expand</i>) </summary><p>

The analysis of network data has received increasing attention motivated by the study of complex systems with interactive units. Examples of these systems appearin social, biological and technological networks, among others fields. My work in this area focuses in addressing estimation and inference problems by exploiting low-dimensional representations using a combination of latent space models and spectral graph inference. I have worked in developing new methodologies with provable theoretical guarantees for performing network inferences tasks including community detection, dimensionality reduction, or graph hypothesis testing, particularly for problems involving multiple networks.

<summary>  <b>Statistical Learning</b> (<i>click to expand</i>)</summary> 

Modern high-dimensional settings in statistics and machine learning are often concerned withvariable selection or regularization approaches to reduce the dimension of the problem andto discover meaningful associations between variables. These tasks become more challengingin complex datasets with additional multi-scale structure in the variables, such as networks,tensors or multimodal data, which often show strong dependence associations between variables. I have worked in developingnew techniques to study these problems by introducing novel regularizations and methodologies that deal with thecomplexity of the data effectively in supervised learning with network-valued covariates, dimensionality reduction, graphical model learning, and applications to brain network classification.

<summary> <b>Pattern Recognition</b> (<i>click to expand</i>)</summary><p> 

Identifying patterns or similarities between nodes is an important task in the study of network data. *Graph matching* is the problem of finding a meaningful correspondence between the nodes of two or more networks, and has applications in fields such as neuroscience, image processing or data security. Part of my work has focused in studying this problem from a statistical framework, by developing flexible and tractable statistical models and efficient computational tools, and analyzing the theoretical performance and limitations of these methodologies.
